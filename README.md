FOR THE GUIDE:

Open Librefox
Search in Searchbar: about:config
copy the text before true/false and change it according to the instructions


FOR THE user.js FILE:

1. Locate the LibreWolf Profile Directory

Windows:
%APPDATA%\LibreWolf\Profiles\
Linux:
~/.librewolf/
macOS:
~/Library/Application Support/LibreWolf/Profiles/

Inside the Profiles folder, you’ll find a folder with a random name (e.g., xxxxxxxx.default). This is your profile directory.


2. Create or Replace the user.js File

Navigate to your profile directory.
If a user.js file already exists, back it up or delete it.
Place your custom user.js file in this directory.



3. Restart LibreWolf

Close and reopen LibreWolf.
Your settings from user.js should now be applied to about:config.
